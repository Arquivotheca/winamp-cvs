<P CLASS="IndentSerif">Welcome to PrimoSDK<SUP>&#153;</SUP> from Sonic Solutions!<BR>
<BR>
PrimoSDK is a toolkit that makes it easy to add CD and DVD reading and writing capabilities to applications running under the following Microsoft<SUP>&#174;</SUP> 32- and 64-bit operating systems: Windows<SUP>&#174;</SUP> 98SE, Windows NT 4 (Service Pack 4 or later), Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP&#47;, XP Media Center Edition and Windows Vista.<BR>
<BR>
PrimoSDK&#39;s full-featured API is supplied as a DLL that runs on top of the Sonic Record Engine (Px Engine). Functions and parameters have been optimized for calling from C&#47;C++ or Visual Basic applications.<BR>
<BR>

Demo versions are protected by the same restrictions that apply to full versions.

<P CLASS="IndentSerif">The PrimoSDK API is contained in only one DLL (<SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.dll</SPAN>), which is called using the linking library <SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.lib </SPAN>and the include file <SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.h</SPAN>. When using Visual Basic, the programmer will need <SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.bas</SPAN>, which contains all the constants and function definitions.<BR>
<BR>
Because <SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.dll </SPAN>is a layer over the Px Engine, when you install an application that uses PrimoSDK, you also need to install all components required for successful operation of Px Engine. <SPAN CLASS="Courier_New_Inline">PrimoSDK.dll </SPAN>will not load if the Px Engine is not installed. For information on installing the required files, see <A HREF="PS_Guide_2.htm#PrimoSDK Installation"><SPAN CLASS="Arial_Inline"><B>PrimoSDK Installation</B></SPAN></A> in Chapter 2.<BR>
