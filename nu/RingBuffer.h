 *  Ring Buffer class
 *  Thread safety:
 *   This class can be used from exactly two simultaneous threads without locking
 *   as long as one thread only writes and the other thread only reads
 *   the writer thread may call empty(), avail(), size(), write(), fill(
 *   the reader thread my call empty(), avail(), size(), read(), peek(), advance()
 *
 *   two (or more) readers or two (or more) writers requires external locking
 *
 *   Reset(), reserve(), clear(), LockBuffer(), UnlockBuffer() are not thread-safe

		2) call LockBuffer(), it'll give you a buffer
		3) call UnlockBufer() with how much you've written
		4) you catch the man
