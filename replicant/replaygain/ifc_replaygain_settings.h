/* ok, this could have easily been a config group, but I decided to make it its own interface for two reasons
1) it's a little more maintainable and easier to understand and use, rather than just using a generic key/value interface
2) the original ReplayGain specs suggests using the average gain of the last 10 played tracks in cases of missing replay gain data
http://replaygain.hydrogenaudio.org/proposal/player_scale.html
So we need a way to have the playback object pass along gain values so they can be averages in this way
