**
** Usage:
**   1. Create a JNL_Connection object, optionally specifying a JNL_AsyncDNS
**      object to use (or NULL for none, or JNL_CONNECTION_AUTODNS for auto),
**      and the send and receive buffer sizes.
**   2. Call connect() to have it connect to a host/port (the hostname will be 
**      resolved if possible).
**   3. call run() with the maximum send/recv amounts, and optionally parameters
**      so you can tell how much has been send/received. You want to do this a lot, while:
**   4. check get_state() to check the state of the connection. The states are:
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_ERROR
**          - an error has occured on the connection. the connection has closed,
**            and you can no longer write to the socket (there still might be 
**            data in the receive buffer - use recv_bytes_available()). 
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_NOCONNECTION
**          - no connection has been made yet. call connect() already! :)
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_RESOLVING
**          - the connection is still waiting for a JNL_AsycnDNS to resolve the
**            host. 
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_CONNECTING
**          - the asynchronous call to connect() is still running.
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_CONNECTED
**          - the connection has connected, all is well.
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_CLOSING
**          - the connection is closing. This happens after a call to close,
**            without the quick parameter set. This means that the connection
**            will close once the data in the send buffer is sent (data could
**            still be being received when it would be closed). After it is 
**            closed, the state will transition to:
**        JNL_Connection::STATE_CLOSED
**          - the connection has closed, generally without error. There still
**            might be data in the receieve buffer, use recv_bytes_available().
**   5. Use send() and send_string() to send data. You can use 
**      send_bytes_in_queue() to see how much has yet to go out, or 
**      send_bytes_available() to see how much you can write. If you use send()
**      or send_string() and not enough room is available, both functions will 
**      return error ( < 0)
**   6. Use recv() and recv_line() to get data. If you want to see how much data 
**      there is, use recv_bytes_available() and recv_lines_available(). If you 
**      call recv() and not enough data is available, recv() will return how much
**      data was actually read. See comments at the function defs.
**
**   7. To close, call close(1) for a quick close, or close() for a close that will
**      make the socket close after sending all the data sent. 
**  
**   8. delete ye' ol' object.
