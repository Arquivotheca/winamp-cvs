 *

 *
 *       ImageHeight - Height (in pixels) of the image to be processed
 *       
 *       YBuffer     - Pointer to buffer where we should place the converted Y data.  The caller needs to
 *                     ensure that sufficent memory is allocated.  We do not check.
 *                   
 *       UBuffer     - Pointer to buffer where we should place the converted U data.  The caller needs to
 *                     ensure that sufficent memory is allocated.  We do not check.
 *

 *                     ensure that sufficent memory is allocated.  We do not check.
 *  
 * Outputs:
 *       YBuffer     - Buffer filled with RGB data converted to YV12 format
 *
 *       UBuffer     - Buffer filled with RGB data converted to YV12 format
 *
 *       VBuffer     - Buffer filled with RGB data converted to YV12 format
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *       Assumes that InitCCLib has been called to initilize this function pointer
 *
 *       We assume that the width and height of the image passed in is even.  If it is not
 *       the last line and column will get bad U and V values.  This is due to us averging
 *       4x4 block to get U and V values.
 *
 * Formulas:
 *       Cb = U
 *       Cr = V
 *
 *       Y  =  0.257R + 0.504G + 0.098B + 16
 *       Cb = -0.148R - 0.291G + 0.439B + 128
 *       Cr =  0.439R - 0.368G - 0.071B + 128
 *
 * The formulas above were obtained from the book Video Demistyfied.
 *
 * The YV12 format drops every other U and V across and every other U, V vertical line.
 * To calculate U and V we will average the 4 RGB values before we convert to U and V.
 * This is slightly less accurate than converting the 4 RGB values to 4 U and V values
 * and then averaging the U and V values.  The plus side of averaging before is that
 * we the coversion is about 10% faster than if we were to convert the values and then 
 * average.
 *
 * We process the image in 2x2 blocks.  From left to right then from top to bottom.
 * Given the following image we will process it in the following order
 *
 *  1) (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
 *  2) (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)
 *  3) (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)
 *  4) (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
 *

 *    +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *    | 3,0 | 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3 |
 *    +-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *
 * To try and avoid rounding errors we are going to scale the number and only
 * convert when we write the number to memory.
 *
 * When we finally scale the numbers down we will round values with fractions
 * greater than .5 up and less than .5 down.  To achieve this we add in a round
 * factor which is equal to half of the amount that we divide by.
 *
 * The values that this function generates for Y, Cr, Cb are very accurate.
 * Utilizing double precision floating point will not generate more accurate
 * results.
 *
 * When converting from the 32-bit Y, Cb, Cr to the 8-bit Y, Cb, Cr values we do
 * not need to worry about over flowing the 8-bit value.  Using the worst R, G, B
 * values we get the following Min and Max values for Y, Cb, Cr.
