The color modifier allows you to modify the intensity of each color
channel with respect to itself. For example, you could reverse the red
channel, double the green channel, or half the blue channel.

The code in the 'level' section should adjust the variables
'red', 'green', and 'blue', whose value represent the channel
intensity (0..1).
Code in the 'frame' or 'level' sections can also use the variable
'beat' to detect if it is currently a beat.
