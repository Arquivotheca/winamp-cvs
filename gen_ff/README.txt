- unzip skindirectory.zip into your Winamp2 Skins directory. for now, gen_ff will manually load an
	unzipped mmd3.
- unzip plugindirectory in the ... wa2 plugin directory :) these are the xml and png files for default
	objects look, skins rely on that for fallback, it's also where we put the new art if we need
	any (ie static bucketitems will go there eventually instead of being resources)
