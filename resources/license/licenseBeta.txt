A waveform signature does not contain any information about you or your computer, and computing the waveform signature should have no noticeable effect on the performance of your computer. For more information, see the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page, and the Privacy Policy for the Gracenote Service.

The Gracenote Client and each item of Gracenote Data are licensed to you "AS IS".
