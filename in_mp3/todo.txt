Changes:
  * [a7] made seeking work (slightly) better on realshitbox encoded mp3s (with broken
    VBR headers)
  * [a7] made save http file location persistent when turned off
  * [a7] fixed id3v2 bug (1 character strings not being displayed correctly)
  * [a6] fixed stupid file association bug (oops)
  * [a5] fixed crash when repeating a non-existing file bug (added a Sleep())
  * [a5] fixed shoutcast disk writer issue
  * [a5] fixed SendMessage() potential issues (using postmessage and SendMessageTimeout() now)
  * [a5] added new format-for-non-id3 files, added 'use id3 tag' option, which lets you disable them
         completely
  * [a5] return of the file association list
  * [a5] made temp file handling slightly better-- checks for read only, better error messages.
  * [a4] fixed lots of potential (and a few serious) bugs in id3lib. 
  * [a4] fixed pause right after playback starts bug
  * fixed crash/hang/freeze when reading some mp3 files with a weird id3v2 tag (as found in some
    real jukebox generated mp3s, etc...)
  * this one will break a few things (i.e. windowshade vis), because justin is updating it to go 
    with winamp 2.7
  * all code is now win32 file io
  * %a will now display id3v1.1/v2 track #
  * fixed id3v1 reading bug that added year field in album field
  * why does it ask me to stop the currently playing file when updating an id3v2 tag ?
    answer:
    whenever you strip or update an id3v2 tag, it creates a tmp file (FILENAME.new), 
    writes it out, and if it wrote it out correctly, then it renames the original 
    to FILENAME.bak, and renames the new one to FILENAME, and if that was successful, 
    then deletes FILENAME.bak). this is required because of the implementation of the
    id3v2 protocol.

  * [a16] corrected crash/bug in id3v2 genre reading
  * [a16] corrected id3v2 comment editor to support multiple lines :)

          when id3v2 can't be updated because file is locked
  * [a16] added track number id3v2 field
  * [a16] id3v2 warnings no more appear under id3 tag editor
  * [a10] streaming info improvements/fixes
  * [a10] made more options for streaming title formatting (for you brennan)
  * [a10] still needs better id3v2 reading writing. THIS IS ON THE WAY, CHILL.
  * [a9] improved streaming error notification (i.e. on can't connect, can't resolve, timeout)
  * [a9] made streaming detect id3v2 tag and skip it (todo: make it look at the id3v2 tag and use it)
  * [a9] updated id3v2 support to detect invalid id3v2 tags, and autodetect their actual 
         size
  * [a9] info box now tells you where the first mpeg header was found (useful)
  * [a8] fixed live365 streaming (they need a space between User-Agent: 
         and the agent string. those assclowns.)

  * [a4] optimized huffman decoding
  * [a3] improved network code. updates status in title area.
  * [a3] layer 1/2 eq code
  * [a3] optimized decoder some more. we can still make it a bit faster me thinks.
  * [a3] moved more code into decode thread.. should act much more asynchronously
  * [a2] Improved skip robustness
  * [a2] Optimized decoder for ppro. changed 8 bit mode for speed.
  * [a2] partial ID3V2 support
  * Fully ISO compliant decoder (based on FHG's implementation)
    * Also fully supports MPEG 2.5 low bitrates.
  * Full MPEG Layer 1 and Layer 2 support
  * Improved equalizer code
  * Optimized visualization data generation code
  * Improved network code (single threaded)
  * Lots of other cleanups

todo:
  make more blip resistant (see pvd.mp3)
  remove seek-blip
