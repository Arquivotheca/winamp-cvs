to fix

crash on shutdown


/////------------ 1.1 below --------------
automatically switch to 'custom' if you click on dropdown in "add" or "edit" url dialog

need icon for listened media
maybe one for read text?

strip whitespace from beginning of titles

multiple-select

Allow for customizing the download location in add/edit url

deletable items (needs to move to a separate 'deleted items' list so we don't re-add them next rss refresh)

drag-n-drop from webpages

once we get an HTTP 200, we should put the downloaded on the 'downloads' list, and be able to update the download percentage status as necessary

new way of listing items
---
create a common "items" data structure that select channels add their items to.
When a channel is select, it adds its items.
When a channel is deselected, it removes its items.
When a channel is refreshed, it re-adds its items (assuming the item-adder function protects against dupes)
only potential issue is if a channel somehow "loses" items (or an item's GUID is changes)
could be fixed by either 1) keeps track of "parent channel" in the items list
2) rebuilding the entire items list on every channel refresh
or 3) preventing GUID changes and item deletions (or forcing an item list rebuild if it does occur)
