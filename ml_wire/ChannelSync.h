/*
ChannelSync is a virtual base class (aka interface) used by the RSS downloader.
When you instantiate a downloader, you are required to give it a pointer to this interface.
 
The downloader will call:
 
	BeginChannelSync();
	for (;;) // however many it encounters
	  NewChannel(newChannel); // called once for each channel it downloads
	EndChannelSync();
 
If you have a class or data structure that wants updates, you'll have to mix-in
this interface or implement a data-structure-babysitter class (or however you want to deal with it)
 
See the "WireManager" for an example of how to use it
