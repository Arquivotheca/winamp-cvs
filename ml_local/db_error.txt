
There was an error reading the local database. This could be due to the database becoming corrupted or having been removed.

If the database files (main.dat and main.idx) have become corrupted then unless you have a back up, you will need to reset the database and then re-add any media files required back into the database.

By resetting the database, any custom ratings and play counts not already stored in the media file(s) will be lost which also will have happened if the database was corrupted.
